# CodeClan Caraoke (CCC)

This exercise is to build software for a Karaoke bar.  It has been written
using Test Driven Development (TDD) and unit testing.

The `run_tests.py` program will run the tests.

`runner.py` is a short program to simulate using the classes developed.

There are some [design notes](DESIGN.md).
